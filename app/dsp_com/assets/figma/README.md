# Figma exports

Put exported PNGs from your Figma file here.

Expected filenames used by the app:
- `empress_pedal_bg.png`  (pedal background/body)
- `empress_knob.png`      (knob face)

How to export:
1. In Figma select the node.
2. Right sidebar → **Export** → PNG.
3. Save with the exact filenames above into this folder.

The Flutter UI will fall back to the old `FlutterOKnob` look if these assets are missing.
